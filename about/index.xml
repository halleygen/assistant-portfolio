      <description>I was assigned to CEIP El Peralejo, which is a primary school (1st - 6th grade) and a pre-school (3 - 5 years old). It is located in Alpedrete, a small town in the mountains to the north-west of Madrid.
 El Peralejo was opened on 18th November 2000, and has 27 teachers and about 400 students. There are two classes for each grade in the primary school and each age level in the pre-school.</description>

      <title>Teaching Experience</title>

      <description>Assigned Classes and Subjects I was usually only assigned English classes. This is because El Peralejo is not a bilingual school, so the only subjects not taught in Spanish are French and English. My timetable was organised such that I did one English lesson each week with every class in the school. I liked this because it meant that I could spend time with all of the students, but it could also be challenging because it took me much longer to get to know them.</description>

      <description>Watching the Students Improve The Australian Accent One of the things that I commonly hear from people who speak English as a second language is that Australians speak too quickly and have a difficult accent. As I have spent so much time living outside of Australia, my accent is not very strong; however, I knew that it could still prove to be challenging for some of the students and teachers at school because they are mostly used to hearing British and American people.</description>
