      <description>I was assigned to CEIP El Peralejo, which is a primary school (1st - 6th grade) and a pre-school (3 - 5 years old). It is located in Alpedrete, a small town in the mountains to the north-west of Madrid.
 El Peralejo was opened in &amp;lt;#year#&amp;gt; and has about 400 students and 27 teachers. They have one English and one French language assistant. I am the second English language assistant to be at the school.</description>

      <description>The Australian Accent One of the things that I commonly hear from people who speak English as a second language is that Australians speak too quickly and have a difficult accent. As I have spent so much time living outside of Australia, my accent is not very strong; however, I knew that it could still prove to be challenging for some of the students and teachers at school because they are mostly used to hearing British and American people.</description>
