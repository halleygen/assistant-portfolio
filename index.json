	"content": " Personal Background I have always been fascinated with foreign languages and cultures. One Christmas when I was little my grandparents gave me an illustrated version of the Tower of Babel story and since then I have felt that being able to speak multiple languages is almost like having a superpower. I wanted to be able to speak every language! While I have given up on that dream (although I did end up learning Spanish, which means I know twice the number of languages I used to ðŸ˜œ), my desire to not only learn to communicate in a foreign language, but to help others to communicate in my language has only grown.\nI was born in Australia, but my family and I have always moved around a lot because of my father\u0026rsquo;s work. I have been fortunate enough to live in many places, both within Australia and around the world. The first time we moved overseas was to the Philippines when I first encountered Spanish. The Philippines was previously a Spanish colony, so the language and culture of the country has a lot of Hispanic influences: la pelota vasca is a popular sport, Filipinos like to take a siesta in the afternoon, bistek, tocino and adobo are famous Filipino dishes. This interested me, so when I offered Spanish or Chinese as a foreign language at school I chose Spanish.\nAfter graduating from high school I returned to Australia to study finance and economics at university. At my university it was compulsory to take one subject unrelated to your major each semester. People from my faculty tended to take business law, but that seemed incredibly boring to me so I decided to continue with Spanish. In these classes we read a lot of Spanish literary works like La casa de Bernarda Alba and Don Quijote, which made me want to visit the country where these stories were set even more.\nTowards the end of my university course I heard about the Language Assists Programme from one of my Spanish teachers and couldn\u0026rsquo;t resist the opportunity to apply.\nExpectations for the Language Assistant Programme Making This Website I made this website using Hugo, an open source project that generates static websites from markdown files. It is hosted by Github Pages, which lets you host a website from a git repository for free. The theme I used is a simple one called hugo-theme-learn.\nAlthough this method requires some familiarity with command-line tools, it requires next to no knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, etc. I found it much simpler than using the clunkier, yet more well known, web apps like Google Sites or Wix, which have made me tear my hair out in the past. Another benefit is that because Github Pages is based around git, everything is kept under source control, which makes it trivial to see every edit you have ever made to the site or its content.\nI would recommend this method to language assistants who plan to do this portfolio project in the future.\n"

It is located in Alpedrete, a small town in the mountains to the north-west of Madrid.\n I chose to live in the centre of Madrid rather than in Alpedrete, which was possible because the public transport is so good. Each morning I take the metro to the Intercambiador de Moncloa then catch a bus to Alpedrete. This commute takes about one hour each way from door to door.\nEl Peralejo was opened on 18th November 2000, and has 27 teachers and about 400 students. There are two classes for each grade in the primary school and each age level in the pre-school. They have two language assistants: an English-speaking one (me) and a French-speaking one. I am the second English language assistant to have worked at the school.\nÂ¡Â¡Â¡Cecile, nuestra auxiliar de conversaciÃ³n de francÃ©s vuelve a nuestro Centro este curso!!!...

Classes begin at 9:00am and end at 2:00pm, with a 30 minute lunch break at 11:45am.\nThe school is not a multilingual school, which means that all classes are given in Spanish, with the exception of English and French. Despite this, foreign languages remain a core part of the students\u0026rsquo; curriculum and most classes have English everyday.\nContact Details  Website: CEIP El Peralejo Twitter: @cpelperalejo  "

The celebrations were broken into two parts: before lunchtime the kids played cricket, a sport that is extremely popular in Australia but almost entirely unknown in Spain, and after lunch the kids did various activies related to Australian culture (like Aboriginal artwork, singing traditional Australian songs, and reading Australian stories).\nSome of the activities that I helped to organise were:\n Australian Stories   Alphabet Game   Cricket   "

	"content": " Assigned Classes and Subjects I was usually only assigned English classes. This is because El Peralejo is not a bilingual school, so the only subjects not taught in Spanish are French and English. My timetable was organised such that I did one English lesson each week with every class in the school. I liked this because it meant that I could spend time with all of the students, but it could also be challenging because it took me much longer to get to know them.\nOn special occasions, like leading up to the Australia Day event, my timetable was temporarily changed so that I could help to teach other subjects, such as physical education.\nGoals Goals for Me My primary goal is to become more confident at teaching and communicating new things to other people. When I am working with the kids I pretend that I cannot speak any Spanish so that they will not fall back to speaking their native language in more difficult situations instead of having a go in English. This means that there are plenty of times when I have to find ways to effectively convey complex and abstract concepts in a way that is easy for a child to understand. As the well known (and misattributed) Einstein quote \u0026ldquo;If you can\u0026rsquo;t explain it simply, you don\u0026rsquo;t understand it well enough\u0026rdquo; goes, I feel that improving this skill will help me to teach my students much better.\nMy secondary goal is to improve my level of Spanish. Although the majority of my students still believe that I do not speak any Spanish, there are still lots of times where I need to be able to effectively communicate in Spanish, for example, with people in Alpedrete that make up the El Peralejo community (like the family of the kids), and with teachers or other faculty members who do not speak English. Due to this I think that this is an important goal.\nGoals for Learners The main goal for my students is for them to feel more comfortable speaking in English. Speaking has been the most challenging part of learning Spanish for me because it makes me feel self-conscious that I cannot always express myself as well as I would in my native tongue. I hope that as the children get to know me and practice with me they can feel much more confident communicating with someone in a foreign language.\nAnother goal I have is for them to improve their vocabulary and fluency. In my experience there are certain things that you cannot learn about a language with the resources that are typically available in a classroom (e.g. textbooks) because they can be too \u0026ldquo;static\u0026rdquo;. Although Spanish and English seem to be very similar at first, speaking one as you would the other sounds very strange (and can sometimes mean an extremely different thing) to a native speaker. I hope that I can complement their normal English classes and help them with this.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "One of the after lunchtime activities was reading an Australian story. For some classes this was a collection of tales from Aboriginal mythology and for others it was Edward the Emu by Sheena Knowles.\nThe Aboriginal tales were popular because they are told in very different way compared to European stories. They also seemed to enjoy learning about Aboriginal culture because it is unique and so distinct from that of Spain. Of the three tales shown to the children, the one they liked the most was the story of Tiddalik, a frog who greedily decides to drink all the water in Australia.\nEdward the Emu is an Australian picture book about an emu who lives in a zoo and pretends to be various different animals after deciding that being an emu is boring. In my experience at El Peralejo anything that involves the unique animals found only in Australia, such as emus, platypuses, kangaroos, goes down very well. This was no exception and kids enjoyed this story a lot, too. Furthermore, I think this is good story for primary school students because it teaches them an important message: to be yourself.\nAfter reading the stories, the children were broken up into groups and given a collection of words, which they had to put in the correct order to recreate a sentence from the story. After each group had finished, they had to work out the order of their sentence in the story, relative to the other groups.\nMy main piece of advice for reading stories to children, regardless of whether are are 3 years old or in 6th grade is to make them as interactive as possible. Most kids love opportunities to speak English so I make sure to ask questions about what has happened/what will happen/what does this word mean/why is this happening/etc while reading. This has the additional benefit of helping those with weaker English skills to follow the story by slowing down the pace.\n"

	"content": " Watching the Students Improve The Australian Accent One of the things that I commonly hear from people who speak English as a second language is that Australians speak too quickly and have a difficult accent. As I have spent so much time living outside of Australia, my accent is not very strong; however, I knew that it could still prove to be challenging for some of the students and teachers at school because they are mostly used to hearing British and American people.\nDespite this everyone has been patient and one of the highlights of the LA programme for me is hearing how some of the students have started to pick up my Australian accent. It is particularly noticable in words such as \u0026ldquo;No\u0026rdquo;, which has a distinct pronounciation in Australian English.\nThe Preschoolers The preschoolers are some of my favourite students because they do so many adorable things. Also, as they are only just starting to learn English, the progress they make is much more apparent.\nOne of the five-year-olds I have a class with has an American father, so his English level is pretty much the same as a five-year-old from an English speaking country. For the first couple of weeks he was very timid and hardly spoke to anyone in English, but as we spent more time together in class he began to warm up to me. Now he is very talkative and asks me very cute questions like \u0026ldquo;Do you go home to Australia every day after school?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Do you know Kevin?\u0026rdquo;. Kevin turned out to be his uncle who happens to live in Australia, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t know him.\nAnother time, I read the four-year-olds a book about a monster who changes colour depending on the emotion he feels (e.g. red when angry, blue when sad, pink when in love). The next day when I asked one of them how he was he responded that was \u0026ldquo;pink for Miguel, Eloy y Joel\u0026rdquo; who are his best friends.\n"

As I did this activity mainly with 5-6 year olds, they often tried to get away with this while they were getting warmed up.\nAlso, make sure that there are enough boys and girls clothes included in the pictures; some students get bored if they have to design outfits for the other gender.\nI found that this activity worked best when there was a good mix of normal and weird clothes to choose from.\n"

At their most simple they can be Is it a\u0026hellip;? and more difficult ones can be asking about the characteristics of the item in the box.\nThe person who successfully guesses what is in the mystery box gets to go next, but towards you may have to let some of the students with poorer English have a go regardless of whether or not they win.\nIt is important to have rules about the kinds of questions and responses that are allowed.

	"content": "This was an activity based on The Alphabet Game game show (the Spanish equivalent was called Pasapalabra). It consisted of a quiz where you had to guess twenty-six words relating to Australia (one for each letter of the English alphabet). Each letter had an associated clue and players worked in teams. The first team to get all twenty-six words correctly is the winner.\nFor example:\n B: One of the colours on the Australian flag: Blue C: A popular sport in Australia: Cricket J: The name for a baby kangaroo: Joey  This activity was probably the most difficult for the students because they don\u0026rsquo;t know much about Australia yet and in order to find a words for a some of the more uncommon letters, like X, you have to choose something niche. To try and counter this I prepared a keynote presentation that covered a various facets of Australian culture, including those in the quiz to help the students. This was presented to them before the day and was played on repeat while they were doing it.\nI found this activity to be a fun way for the kids to learn about Australia and improve their vocabulary. That being said, I think that it would only work successfully with older students who can work more independently. In this scenario, only grades 4 - 6 did this activity.\nIf I could change one thing about the way that I planned this activity it would to be more aware about the pop culture differences between the people my age and the children. For example, for the letter N I had A famous Australian actress who was married to Tom Cruise: Nicole Kidman, without realising that no one would know who Nicole Kidman was. If I wanted a question about an Australian actor or actress it would be better to choose someone like Chris Hemsworth because he is much more known by children due to playing Thor in a tonne of superhero movies.\n"

Examples of themes I have taught are:\n family members wild animals colours  Everyone stands in a circle and waits for the teacher to show a flash card and say a word. If what the teacher says corresponds to the presented flash card then the students have to jump, otherwise they have to stay still. If you jump at the wrong time then you are eliminated and have to sit down.\nAfter a few rounds the majority of the students will know the vocabulary words quite well, so you have to become trickier and faster.\nI also like to introduce a rule towards the end where the last person to jump is eliminated to make sure that people aren\u0026rsquo;t just copying their classmates.\nThe kids respond much better if you take part in the game as much as possible. For example, I always made sure to stand in the circle with everyone else. I also jumped along with the students (often at the wrong time to try to trick them).\nAs they start to learn the words, many students will be able to tell when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to trick them and call out the right answer. I encouraged this, because it gets them to speak and gets the eliminated ones to continue paying attention and learning.\n"

	"content": "In the morning of the Australia Day celebrations the children played cricket against each other. I thought that cricket would be a good sport for children in primary school because it is non-contact, and relies more on making intelligent decisions and less on athletic prowess. This means that it should be enjoyed by a greater percentage of the students that sports where this is not the case.\nAlthough cricket is one of the most popular sports in Australia, it is almost unheard of here in Spain. It is quite a complicated game that has a reputation for being notoriously difficult for people in non-cricketing countries to learn. Nevertheless, in the physical education lessons leading up to Australia Day, I helped to teach the kids (and the PE teachers) how to play.\nAfter their first encounters with the game, I was worried that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to work out at all and that it was just too difficult; however, the children quickly improved. After only two classes, they understood the basics of the game and had started to successfully carry out more advanced plays. By the time Australia Day at El Peralejo arrived, they played extremely well and made me very proud.\nAll the children from the primary school took part in this activity (i.e. grades 1 - 6). It went very well with grades 3 - 6. Based on my experience from this project, I would say that children in this age range would need about two hours worth of lessons before they are able to organise and referee matches independently. The feedback from these kids was overwhelmingly positive and I would recommend this activity to other language assistants who are already familiar with the sport.\nOn the other hand, we decided that grades 1 and 2 would practice batting and bowling rather than play a match. This is because the large number of rules proved to be too complicated for them to learn in the time available and they ended up spending too much time being confused to properly enjoy the activity.\nAfter carrying out this activity, the two main tips I have for anyone who would want to try teaching cricket to children from a non-cricketing country would be:\n Modify the rules to make the game more dynamic and fast-paced. Although some cricket matches last a week, this is impractical in a primary school setting because a PE lesson usually lasts just an hour and young children get bored easily. The game should be more like that of Twenty20 cricket than a test match. The kids also liked some of the unofficial \u0026ldquo;backyard cricket\u0026rdquo; rules (e.g. catching a ball that has bounced once with one hand elimates the batter, if you hit the ball then you have to run, etc.). Practice explaining the rules to another person who hasn\u0026rsquo;t played the game before attempting to do it to your students. The sport is complex and in my case I found it hard to put the rules into words in a concise and comprehensible way on the spot, despite having played since I was a child. It\u0026rsquo;s also import to note that there are words that exist in English with no nice equivalent in Spanish, for example, some pieces of equipment (wickets, bails) and fielding.  "

It involves the children finding something of a particular colour and showing you.\nYou start by choosing one of the flash cards and singing the following song (adjust the lyrics for the current colour, obviously):\n I see something blue\nBLUE!\nI see something blue\nBLUE! BLUE!\nI see something blue\nFIND SOMETHING BLUE!\n Upon reaching the end of the song the children have to find an object from around the classroom that is the right colour and bring it you. After everyone has shown you something (or a reasonable amount of time has passed) you call out STOP! and everyone has to return to their seat.\nIt is important to ensure that everyone follows rules like no running, putting things back neatly when you\u0026rsquo;re finished with them, returning to your seat upon hearing STOP!, etc. A good way to discipline children who don\u0026rsquo;t follow these rules is to have to sit out for a round. As much of the game consists of around twenty 3 year olds excitedly searching the classroom it\u0026rsquo;s important that everyone does what they are supposed to.\nAlso, you should make sure that as many children sing along with you as possible, otherwise you get in the situation where there are many who can understand the colours in English, but not actually say them.\n"

I studied Finance at the University of Melbourne.\nUnlike many other English speaking countries, Australia is not very exposed to other languages. English is the only language spoken by a significant portion of the population, and learning foreign languages is not usually taken very seriously because we live so far away from the rest of the world.\n Fortunately for me, I grew up overseas and have lived in various countries around Asia and North America, and foreign languages were considered much more important in the schools that I attended. This is when I had my first encounters with the Spanish language. Despite it being a compulsory class, Spanish ended up being one of my favourite subjects, so much so that once I started university, I decided to do various Spanish literature courses as my electives, leaving my friends to enjoy Business Law by themselves.\nI wanted to take part in the Language Assistants Programme because I thought that it would be a good opportunity to improve my Spanish and to get to experience all the wonderful parts of Spain that I had spent so much time learning about at school. So far, it has lived up to my expectations and I have enjoyed working at a school in Spain a lot. I would recommend this programme to anyone who has an interest Spanish culture and working with kids.\nThe school I work at is CEIP El Peralejo, which is located in Alpedrete, Madrid.
