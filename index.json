It is located in Alpedrete, a small town in the mountains to the north-west of Madrid.\n El Peralejo was opened in \u0026lt;#year#\u0026gt; and has about 400 students and 27 teachers. They have one English and one French language assistant. I am the second English language assistant to be at the school.\nÂ¡Â¡Â¡Cecile, nuestra auxiliar de conversaciÃ³n de francÃ©s vuelve a nuestro Centro este curso!!!...

This is because El Peralejo is not a bilingual school, so the only subjects not taught in Spanish are French and English. My timetable was organised such that I did one English lesson each week with every class in the school. I liked this because it meant that I could spend time with all of the students, but it could also be challenging because it took me much longer to get to know them.\nOn special occasions, like leading up to the Australia Day event, my timetable was temporarily changed so that I could help to teach other subjects, such as physical education.\n"

I found that two to four students was usually a good amount. Each person takes a turn to design an outfit using the cutout pictures, and the others have to say what someone in this outfit would be wearing.\nIn between rounds, when a person designing their outfit, another person should stand up and either tell the others what they are wearing or be told what they are wearing by someone else.\nIt is important to make sure that the students respond properly (i.e. in full sentences) rather than just listing the items that make up the outfit. As I did this activity mainly with 5-6 year olds, they often tried to get away with this while they were getting warmed up.\nAlso, make sure that there are enough boys and girls clothes included in the pictures; some students get bored if they have to design outfits for the other gender.\nI found that this activity worked best when there was a good mix of normal and weird clothes to choose from.\n"

I found that four to five students was usually a good amount. Each person puts on their hat and an animal flash card is sat in its brim, such that no one can knows the card that is in their hat, but can see those of their classmates.\nNext, each person takes a turn to ask a question to try to guess the animal on their flash card until everyone has worked out who they have. The first person to guess their animal gets to choose which animal another player is for the next round.\nIt is important to have rules about the kinds of questions and responses that are allowed.

A popular one was that every question had to compare yourself to another player (e.g. Am I taller than\u0026hellip;?/Can I swim better than\u0026hellip;?).\n"

If what the teacher says corresponds to the presented flash card then the students have to jump, otherwise they have to stay still. If you jump at the wrong time then you are eliminated and have to sit down.\nAfter a few rounds the majority of the students will know the vocabulary words quite well, so you have to become trickier and faster.\nI also like to introduce a rule towards the end where the last person to jump is eliminated to make sure that people aren\u0026rsquo;t just copying their classmates.\nThe kids respond much better if you take part in the game as much as possible.

I\u0026rsquo;m an Australian who is taking part in the 2018\\/2019 Auxiliares de ConversaciÃ³n programme.\nI am from a small town in Queensland, but I have spent a lot of time living in other parts of the world. I studied Finance at the University of Melbourne.\nUnlike many other English speaking countries, Australia is not very exposed to other languages. English is the only language spoken by a significant portion of the population, and learning foreign languages is not usually taken very seriously because we live so far away from the rest of the world.\nFortunately for me, I grew up overseas and have lived in various countries around Asia and North America, and foreign languages were considered much more important in the schools that I attended. This is when I had my first encounters with the Spanish language. Despite it being a compulsory class, Spanish ended up being one of my favourite subjects, so much so that once I started university, I decided to do various Spanish literature courses as my electives, leaving my friends to enjoy Business Law by themselves.\nUntil June 2019, I will be working at CEIP El Peralejo, which is located in Alpedrete, Madrid. My students range from 3 year olds to 6th graders.\n "

It is intended to help the children to learn how to use the prepositions of place in English. The two second grade classes had a class \u0026ldquo;pet\u0026rdquo;, a stuffed rat, who all the kids liked a lot.\nThis activity involves putting the pet rat around various objects in the classroom and having everyone describe where he is relative to the object.\nSome examples are:\n Putting rat inside a backpack ==\u0026gt; Rat is inside the backpack Putting rat under the table ==\u0026gt; Rat is under the table Putting rat between two books ==\u0026gt; Rat is between the books  I liked this activity because it also involved practicing the classroom objects vocabulary that the children had previously studied.\nAt the end I would give the children a command (e.g. Stand next to the table) or have them take turns giving a command to their classmates and they would have to act it out. This was also popular, but was only effective on days when they werenÂ´t crazy.\n"
