	"content": " Classes I did this activity with:  1st, 2nd  Required materials:  Cutout pictures of different articles of clothing  Description: This is an activity that is done in small groups. I found that two to four students was usually a good amount. Each person takes a turn to design an outfit using the cutout pictures, and the others have to say what someone in this outfit would be wearing.\nIn between rounds, when a person designing their outfit, another person should stand up and either tell the others what they are wearing or be told what they are wearing by someone else.\nIt is important to make sure that the students respond properly (i.e. in full sentences) rather than just listing the items that make up the outfit. As I did this activity mainly with 5-6 year olds, they often tried to get away with this while they were getting warmed up.\nAlso, make sure that there are enough boys and girls clothes included in the pictures; some students get bored if they have to design outfits for the other gender.\nI found that this activity worked best when there was a good mix of normal and weird clothes to choose from.\n"

I found that four to five students was usually a good amount. Each person puts on their hat and an animal flash card is sat in its brim, such that no one can knows the card that is in their hat, but can see those of their classmates.\nNext, each person takes a turn to ask a question to try to guess the animal on their flash card until everyone has worked out who they have. The first person to guess their animal gets to choose which animal another player is for the next round.\nIt is important to have rules about the kinds of questions and responses that are allowed. For example, all students had to answer Have I got\u0026hellip;?/Am I\u0026hellip;?/Can I\u0026hellip;? questions with Yes, you have/Yes, you are/No, you can\u0026rsquo;t rather than with just a simple yes or no.\nWith the older students you can have more creative rules. A popular one was that every question had to compare yourself to another player (e.g. Am I taller than\u0026hellip;?/Can I swim better than\u0026hellip;?).\n"

	"content": " Australia Day Celebration Alphabet Game  3 years old, 4 years old, 5 years old  Required materials:  A set of flash cards of any topic  Description: This is a game that is played with an entire class. It is intended to help reinforce the learning of certain words around the same theme. Examples of themes I have taught are:\n family members wild animals colours  Everyone stands in a circle and waits for the teacher to show a flash card and say a word. If what the teacher says corresponds to the presented flash card then the students have to jump, otherwise they have to stay still. If you jump at the wrong time then you are eliminated and have to sit down.\nAfter a few rounds the majority of the students will know the vocabulary words quite well, so you have to become trickier and faster.\nI also like to introduce a rule towards the end where the last person to jump is eliminated to make sure that people aren\u0026rsquo;t just copying their classmates.\nThe kids respond much better if you take part in the game as much as possible. For example, I always made sure to stand in the circle with everyone else. I also jumped along with the students (often at the wrong time to try to trick them).\nAs they start to learn the words, many students will be able to tell when you\u0026rsquo;re trying to trick them and call out the right answer. I encouraged this, because it gets them to speak and gets the eliminated ones to continue paying attention and learning.\n"

It is intended to teach very young children the colours in English. It involves the children finding something of a particular colour and showing you.\nYou start by choosing one of the flash cards and singing the following song (adjust the lyrics for the current colour, obviously):\n I see something blue\nBLUE!\nI see something blue\nBLUE! BLUE!\nI see something blue\nFIND SOMETHING BLUE!\n Upon reaching the end of the song the children have to find an object from around the classroom that is the right colour and bring it you. After everyone has shown you something (or a reasonable amount of time has passed) you call out STOP! and everyone has to return to their seat.\nIt is important to ensure that everyone follows rules like no running, putting things back neatly when you\u0026rsquo;re finished with them, returning to your seat upon hearing STOP!, etc. A good way to discipline children who don\u0026rsquo;t follow these rules is to have to sit out for a round. As much of the game consists of around twenty 3 year olds excitedly searching the classroom it\u0026rsquo;s important that everyone does what they are supposed to.\nAlso, you should make sure that as many children sing along with you as possible, otherwise you get in the situation where there are many who can understand the colours in English, but not actually say them.\n"

	"content": " Jesse\u0026rsquo;s Portfolio Hello! My name is Jesse. I\u0026rsquo;m an Australian who is taking part in the 2018\\/2019 Auxiliares de Conversación programme.\nI am from a small town in Queensland, but I have spent a lot of time living in other parts of the world. I studied Finance at the University of Melbourne.\nUnlike many other English speaking countries, Australia is not very exposed to other languages. English is the only language spoken by a significant portion of the population, and learning foreign languages is not usually taken very seriously because we live so far away from the rest of the world.\nFortunately for me, I grew up overseas and have lived in various countries around Asia and North America, and foreign languages were considered much more important in the schools that I attended. This is when I had my first encounters with the Spanish language. Despite it being a compulsory class, Spanish ended up being one of my favourite subjects, so much so that once I started university, I decided to do various Spanish literature courses as my electives, leaving my friends to enjoy Business Law by themselves.\nUntil June 2019, I will be working at CEIP El Peralejo, which is located in Alpedrete, Madrid. My students range from 3 year olds to 6th graders.\n "
