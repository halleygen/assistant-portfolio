<h4 id="description">Description:</h4>

<p>This is a game that is played with an entire class. It is intended to teach very young children the colours in English. It involves the children finding something of a particular colour and showing you.</p>

<p>You start by choosing one of the flash cards and singing the following song (adjust the lyrics for the current colour, obviously):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see something blue<br />
BLUE!<br />
I see something blue<br />
BLUE! BLUE!<br />
I see something blue<br />
FIND SOMETHING BLUE!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon reaching the end of the song the children have to find an object from around the classroom that is the right colour and bring it you. After everyone has shown you something (or a reasonable amount of time has passed) you call out <em>STOP!</em> and everyone has to return to their seat.</p>

<p>It is important to ensure that everyone follows rules like no running, putting things back neatly when you&rsquo;re finished with them, returning to your seat upon hearing <em>STOP!</em>, etc. A good way to discipline children who don&rsquo;t follow these rules is to have to sit out for a round. As much of the game consists of around twenty 3 year olds excitedly searching the classroom it&rsquo;s important that everyone does what they are supposed to.</p>

<p>Also, you should make sure that as many children sing along with you as possible, otherwise you get in the situation where there are many who can understand the colours in English, but not actually say them.</p>
