<h4 id="description">Description:</h4>

<p>This is a game that is played in small groups. I found that four to five students was usually a good amount. Each person takes a turn being the one with the mystery box and puts a flash card of their choice in it.</p>

<p>Next, the other players have to ask questions to try and find out what is in the mystery box. The kinds of questions can be varied depending on the English level of the players. At their most simple they can be <em>Is it a&hellip;?</em> and more difficult ones can be asking about the characteristics of the item in the box.</p>

<p>The person who successfully guesses what is in the mystery box gets to go next, but towards you may have to let some of the students with poorer English have a go regardless of whether or not they win.</p>

<p>It is important to have rules about the kinds of questions and responses that are allowed. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Good: <em>Is it a pencil case?</em>  Bad: <em>Pencil case?</em></li>
<li>Good: <em>Yes, it is</em>/<em>No, it isn&rsquo;t</em>  Bad: <em>Yes</em>/<em>No</em></li>
</ul>
