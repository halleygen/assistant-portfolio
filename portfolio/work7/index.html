<h4 id="description">Description:</h4>

<p>This is an activity that is done in small groups. I found that two to four students was usually a good amount. Each person takes a turn to design an outfit using the cutout pictures, and the others have to say what someone in this outfit would be wearing.</p>

<p>In between rounds, when a person designing their outfit, another person should stand up and either tell the others what they are wearing or be told what they are wearing by someone else.</p>

<p>It is important to make sure that the students respond properly (i.e. in full sentences) rather than just listing the items that make up the outfit. As I did this activity mainly with 5-6 year olds, they often tried to get away with this while they were getting warmed up.</p>

<p>Also, make sure that there are enough boys and girls clothes included in the pictures; some students get bored if they have to design outfits for the other gender.</p>

<p>I found that this activity worked best when there was a good mix of normal and weird clothes to choose from.</p>
