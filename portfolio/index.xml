      <description>What am I? Classes I did this activity with:  3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th  Required materials:  Hats for each student (I usually made/had the students make origami hats from sheets of newspaper) Animal flash cards  Description: This is a game that is played in small groups. I found that four to five students was usually a good amount. Each person puts on their hat and an animal flash card is sat in its brim, such that no one can knows the card that is in their hat, but can see those of their classmates.</description>
