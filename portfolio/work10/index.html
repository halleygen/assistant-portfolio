<h4 id="description">Description:</h4>

<p>This is a game that is played with an entire class. It is intended to help reinforce the learning of certain words around the same theme. Examples of themes I have taught are:</p>

<ul>
<li>family members</li>
<li>wild animals</li>
<li>colours</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone stands in a circle and waits for the teacher to show a flash card and say a word. If what the teacher says corresponds to the presented flash card then the students have to jump, otherwise they have to stay still. If you jump at the wrong time then you are eliminated and have to sit down.</p>

<p>After a few rounds the majority of the students will know the vocabulary words quite well, so you have to become trickier and faster.</p>

<p>I also like to introduce a rule towards the end where the last person to jump is eliminated to make sure that people aren&rsquo;t just copying their classmates.</p>

<p>The kids respond much better if you take part in the game as much as possible. For example, I always made sure to stand in the circle with everyone else. I also jumped along with the students (often at the wrong time to try to trick them).</p>

<p>As they start to learn the words, many students will be able to tell when you&rsquo;re trying to trick them and call out the right answer. I encouraged this, because it gets them to speak and gets the eliminated ones to continue paying attention and learning.</p>
