            <h1>Cricket</h1>
          

        


<p>In the morning of the Australia Day celebrations the children played cricket against each other. I thought that cricket would be a good sport for children in primary school because it is non-contact, and relies more on making intelligent decisions and less on athletic prowess. This means that it should be enjoyed by a greater percentage of the students that sports where this is not the case.</p>

<p>Although cricket is one of the most popular sports in Australia, it is almost unheard of here in Spain. It is quite a complicated game that has a reputation for being notoriously difficult for people in non-cricketing countries to learn. Nevertheless, in the physical education lessons leading up to Australia Day, I helped to teach the kids (and the PE teachers) how to play.</p>

<p>After their first encounters with the game, I was worried that it wasn&rsquo;t going to work out at all and that it was just too difficult; however, the children quickly improved. After only two classes, they understood the basics of the game and had started to successfully carry out more advanced plays. By the time Australia Day at El Peralejo arrived, they played extremely well and made me very proud.</p>

<p>All the children from the primary school took part in this activity (i.e. grades 1 - 6). It went very well with grades 3 - 6. Based on my experience from this project, I would say that children in this age range would need about two hours worth of lessons before they are able to organise and referee matches independently. The feedback from these kids was overwhelmingly positive and I would recommend this activity to other language assistants who are already familiar with the sport.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we decided that grades 1 and 2 would practice batting and bowling rather than play a match. This is because the large number of rules proved to be too complicated for them to learn in the time available and they ended up spending too much time being confused to properly enjoy the activity.</p>

<p>After carrying out this activity, the two main tips I have for anyone who would want to try teaching cricket to children from a non-cricketing country would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Modify the rules to make the game more dynamic and fast-paced. Although some cricket matches last a week, this is impractical in a primary school setting because a PE lesson usually lasts just an hour and young children get bored easily. The game should be more like that of Twenty20 cricket than a test match. The kids also liked some of the unofficial &ldquo;backyard cricket&rdquo; rules (e.g. catching a ball that has bounced once with one hand elimates the batter, if you hit the ball then you have to run, etc.).</li>
<li>Practice explaining the rules to another person who hasn&rsquo;t played the game before attempting to do it to your students. The sport is complex and in my case I found it hard to put the rules into words in a concise and comprehensible way on the spot, despite having played since I was a child. It&rsquo;s also import to note that there are words that exist in English with no nice equivalent in Spanish, for example, some pieces of equipment (<em>wickets</em>, <em>bails</em>) and <em>fielding</em>.</li>
</ol>
