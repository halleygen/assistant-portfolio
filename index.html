    Classes I did this activity with:  1st, 2nd  Required materials:  Cutout pictures of different articles of clothing  Description: This is an activity that is done in small groups. I found that two to four students was usually a good amount. Each person takes a turn to design an outfit using the cutout pictures, and the others have to say what someone in this outfit would be wearing.

Each person puts on their hat and an animal flash card is sat in its brim, such that no one can knows the card that is in their hat, but can see those of their classmates.
