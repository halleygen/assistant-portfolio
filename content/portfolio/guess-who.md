#### Classes I did this activity with:

* 3rd, 4th, 5th

#### Required materials:

* Printed, *Guess Who?*-esque images of people

#### Description:

This is a game I played that was based on the *Guess Who?* (*¿Quién es quién?* in Spain) board game. I modified it a little so that it could be done in small groups of around 4 - 5 children. Its purpose was to help the students to learn how to physically describe themselves and others in English.

One of the players is chosen to go first and they have to pick one of the images without telling the others who it is. Each of the other players then has to ask questions like "*Is it a boy or a girl?*"/"*Does he/she have brown hair?*" in order to determine who has been picked. When I was working with just one group I usually went first so the kids had a chance to warm up and remembered the proper kinds of questions and responses.

Once the list of potential candidates has been narrowed down the other players can start asking whether or not it is a particular person. The player who correctly guesses the person gets to be the "chooser" next.

It is important to make sure that questions are being asked and responded to properly. For whatever reason it took the younger kids ages to remember that people can have red and blonde hair, not orange and yellow hair, so I had to spend a lot of time policing them to make sure they used the correct words. Also, they tended to be lazy and just say "*Blue eyes?*" instead of "*Does he have blue eyes?*" if you didn't clearly set expectations at the beginning, so make sure to support them while they are playing.

Occasionally I would have each child in the class colour in their own person and we would play with those instead. They liked this because you would always end up with funny combinations like bearded women, men with pigtails, and aliens with green skin and red eyes.
