#### Classes I did this activity with:

* 3rd, 4th, 5th

#### Required materials:

* Printed, *Guess Who?*-esque images of people

#### Description:

This is a game I played that was based on the *Guess Who?* (*¿Quién es quién?* in Spain) board game. I modified it a little so that it could be done in small groups of around 4 - 5 children. Its purpose was to help the students to learn how to physically describe themselves and others in English.
