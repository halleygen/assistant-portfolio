#### Description:

This was a semi-interactive keynote that I made to complement the "wild animals" unit that the 3rd and 4th grades studied towards the beginning of the school year. I presented it four times and it took about 45 minutes on average.

The focus of this unit was to teach the kids basic animal descriptions. Examples of some of the vocabulary for this unit are *wings*, *fur*, *claws*, *tail*, and *beak*. As this is was the unit after physical human descriptions, any study of the body parts that we share with other animals (e.g. *eyes*) is considered revision.

Each slide of the presentation has a different Australian animal with arrows pointing to various parts of its body and the children have to name that body part. The answers would animate onto the slide upon clicking. I also made sure to teach them different facts about each animal to make the presentation more interesting and also included multimedia such recordings of the animal cries. At the end there are two embedded videos: one about the lyrebird and the other about how kangaroos fight.

In my opinion this presentation was successful mostly because it only featured Australian animals, which are considered very interesting and exotic by the kids here. I think they would have become bored if it had been about animals they are already familiar with, like deer or farm animals.

They also liked the interactive side of the presentation and I found it a good way to get a lot of them talking. More of the students who are normally timid participated, particularly when we were talking about an animal they liked. The thorny devil and Tasmanian devil were both very popular with the boys, and the wombat with the girls.

The audio and video resources were also popular. If I were going to repeat this presentation then I would include more.
