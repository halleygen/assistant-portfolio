#### Classes I did this activity with:

* 1st, 2nd

#### Required materials:

* Cutout pictures of different articles of clothing

#### Description:

This is an activity that is done in small groups. I found that two to four students was usually a good amount. Each person takes a turn to design an outfit using the cutout pictures, and the others have to say what someone in this outfit would be wearing.

In between rounds, when a person designing their outfit, another person should stand up and either tell the others what they are wearing or be told what they are wearing by someone else.

It is important to make sure that the students respond properly (i.e. in full sentences) rather than just listing the items that make up the outfit. As I did this activity mainly with 5-6 year olds, they often tried to get away with this while they were getting warmed up.

Also, make sure that there are enough boys and girls clothes included in the pictures; some students get bored if they have to design outfits for the other gender.

I found that this activity worked best when there was a good mix of normal and weird clothes to choose from.
