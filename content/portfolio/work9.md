# What am I?

#### Classes I did this activity with:

* 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th

#### Required materials:

* Hats for each student (I usually made/had the students make origami hats from sheets of newspaper)
* Animal flash cards

#### Description:

This is a game that is played in small groups. I found that four to five students was usually a good amount. Each person puts on their hat and an animal flash card is sat in its brim, such that no one can knows the card that is in their hat, but can see those of their classmates.

Next, each person takes a turn to ask a question to try to guess the animal on their flash card until everyone has worked out who they have. The first person to guess their animal gets to choose which animal another player is for the next round.

It is important to have rules about the kinds of questions and responses that are allowed. For example, all students had to answer   _Have I got...?/Am I...?/Can I...?_ questions with _Yes, you have/Yes, you are/No, you can't_ rather than with just a simple _yes_ or _no_.

With the older students you can have more creative rules. A popular one was that every question had to compare yourself to another player (e.g. _Am I taller than...?/Can I swim better than...?_).
