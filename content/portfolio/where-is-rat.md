#### Classes I did this activity with:

* 2nd

#### Required materials:

* The classroom pet (preferably one that is not and has not been alive)
* Various objects around which the pet can be placed

#### Description:

This is an activity that I did with the entire class as a warm up. It is intended to help the children to learn how to use the prepositions of place in English. The two second grade classes had a class "pet", a stuffed rat, who all the kids liked a lot. 

This activity involves putting the pet rat around various objects in the classroom and having everyone describe where he is relative to the object.

Some examples are:

* Putting rat inside a backpack ==> __Rat is inside the backpack__
* Putting rat under the table ==> __Rat is under the table__
* Putting rat between two books ==> __Rat is between the books__

I liked this activity because it also involved practicing the classroom objects vocabulary that the children had previously studied.

At the end I would give the children a command (e.g. __Stand next to the table__) or have them take turns giving a command to their classmates and they would have to act it out. This was also popular, but was only effective on days when they werenÂ´t crazy.
