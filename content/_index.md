# Jesse's Portfolio

----------
 
Hello! My name is Jesse. I'm an Australian who is taking part in the 2018 - 2019 Language Assistants programme. 

I come from a small town in Queensland, but I have spent a lot of time living in other parts of the world. Unlike many other English speaking countries, Australia is not very exposed to other languages. English is the only language spoken by a significant portion of the population, and learning foreign languages is not usually taken very seriously because we live so far away from the rest of the world.

I wanted to take part in the Language Assistants Programme because I thought that it would be a good opportunity to improve my Spanish and to get to experience all the wonderful parts of Spain that I had spent so much time learning about at school. So far, it has lived up to my expectations and I have enjoyed working at a school in Spain a lot. I would recommend this programme to anyone who has an interest Spanish culture and working with kids.
