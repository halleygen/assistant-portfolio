# Jesse's Portfolio

----------
 
Hello! My name is Jesse. I'm an Australian who is taking part in the 2018\/2019 Auxiliares de Conversaci√≥n programme. 

I am from a small town in Queensland, but I have spent a lot of time living in other parts of the world. I went to high school in the Philippines and the United States, and I studied Finance at the University of Melbourne. 

Unlike many other English speaking countries, Australia is not very exposed

I work at CEIP El Peralejo, which is located in Alpedrete, Madrid. My students range from 3 year olds to 6th graders.
