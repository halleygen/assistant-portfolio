# Jesse's Portfolio

----------
 
Hello! My name is Jesse. I'm an Australian who is taking part in the 2018\/2019 Language Assistants programme. 

I come from a small town in Queensland, but I have spent a lot of time living in other parts of the world. I studied Finance at the University of Melbourne. 

Unlike many other English speaking countries, Australia is not very exposed to other languages. English is the only language spoken by a significant portion of the population, and learning foreign languages is not usually taken very seriously because we live so far away from the rest of the world.

Fortunately for me, I grew up overseas and have lived in various countries around Asia and North America, and foreign languages were considered much more important in the schools that I attended. This is when I had my first encounters with the Spanish language. Despite it being a compulsory class, Spanish ended up being one of my favourite subjects, so much so that once I started university, I decided to do various Spanish literature courses as my electives, leaving my friends to enjoy Business Law by themselves.

I wanted to take part in the Language Assistants Programme because I thought that it would be a good opportunity to improve my Spanish and to get to experience all the wonderful parts of Spain that I had spent so much time learning about at school. So far, it has lived up to my expectations and I have enjoyed working at a school in Spain a lot. I would recommend this programme to anyone who has an interest Spanish culture and working with kids.
