One of the after lunchtime activities was reading an Australian story. For some classes this was a collection of tales from Aboriginal mythology and for others it was [*Edward the Emu* by Sheena Knowles](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780064434997/edward-the-emu/).

The Aboriginal tales were popular because they are told in very different way compared to European stories. They also seemed to enjoy learning about Aboriginal culture because it is unique and so distinct from that of Spain. Of the three tales shown to the children, the one they liked the most was the story of [*Tiddalik*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiddalik), a frog who greedily decides to drink all the water in Australia.

*Edward the Emu* is an Australian picture book about an emu who lives in a zoo and pretends to be various different animals after deciding that being an emu is boring. In my experience at El Peralejo anything that involves the unique animals found only in Australia, such as emus, platypuses, kangaroos, goes down very well. This was no exception and kids enjoyed this story a lot, too. Furthermore, I think this is good story for primary school students because it teaches them an important message: to be yourself.

After reading the stories, the children were broken up into groups and given a collection of words, which they had to put in the correct order to recreate a sentence from the story. After each group had finished, they had to work out the order of their sentence in the story, relative to the other groups.

My main piece of advice for reading stories to children, regardless of whether are are 3 years old or in 6th grade is to make them as interactive as possible. Most kids love opportunities to speak English so I make sure to ask questions about what has happened/what will happen/what does this word mean/why is this happening/etc while reading. This has the additional benefit of helping those with weaker English skills to follow the story by slowing down the pace.
