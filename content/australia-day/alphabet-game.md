This was an activity based on *The Alphabet Game* game show (the Spanish equivalent was called *Pasapalabra*). It consisted of a quiz where you had to guess twenty-six words relating to Australia (one for each letter of the English alphabet). Each letter had an associated clue and players worked in teams. The first team to get all twenty-six words correctly is the winner.

For example:

* B: *One of the colours on the Australian flag*: **Blue**
* C: *A popular sport in Australia*: **Cricket**
* J: *The name for a baby kangaroo*: **Joey**

This activity was probably the most difficult for the students because they don't know much about Australia yet and in order to find a words for a some of the more uncommon letters, like *X*, you have to choose something niche. To try and counter this I prepared a keynote presentation that covered a various facets of Australian culture, including those in the quiz to help the students. This was presented to them before the day and was played on repeat while they were doing it.

I found this activity to be a fun way for the kids to learn about Australia and improve their vocabulary. That being said, I think that it would only work successfully with older students who can work more independently. In this scenario, only grades 4 - 6 did this activity.

If I could change one thing about the way that I planned this activity it would to be more aware about the pop culture differences between the people my age and the children. For example, for the letter N I had *A famous Australian actress who was married to Tom Cruise*: **Nicole Kidman**, without realising that no one would know who Nicole Kidman was. If I wanted a question about an Australian actor or actress it would be better to choose someone like Chris Hemsworth because he is much more known by children due to playing Thor in a tonne of superhero movies.
