I was assigned to CEIP El Peralejo, which is a primary school (1st - 6th grade) and a pre-school (3 - 5 years old). It is located in Alpedrete, a small town in the mountains to the north-west of Madrid.

I chose to live in the centre of Madrid rather than in Alpedrete, which was possible because the public transport is so good. Each morning I take the metro to the Intercambiador de Moncloa then catch a bus to Alpedrete. This commute takes about one hour each way from door to door.

----------

El Peralejo was opened on 18th November 2000, and has  27 teachers and about 400 students. There are two classes for each grade in the primary school and each age level in the pre-school. They have two language assistants: an English-speaking one (me) and a French-speaking one. I am the second English language assistant to have worked at the school.

Compared to students from schools in more urban areas, the children at El Peralejo are very lucky because their school can take a more practical approach to topics like caring for the environment, geography, etc. They go on many excursions to the nearby mountains and national parks.

A regular school day here is quite different to those that I experienced in Australia, the Philippines and the United States. Classes begin at 9:00am and end at 2:00pm, with a 30 minute lunch break at 11:45am.

The school is not a multilingual school, which means that all classes are given in Spanish, with the exception of English and French. Despite this, foreign languages remain a core part of the students' curriculum and most grades study English everyday.
