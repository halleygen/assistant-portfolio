I was assigned to CEIP El Peralejo, which is a primary school (1st - 6th grade) and a pre-school (3 - 5 years old). It is located in Alpedrete, a small town in the mountains to the north-west of Madrid.

El Peralejo was opened in <#year#> and has about 400 students and 27 teachers. They have one English and one French language assistant. I am the second English language assistant to be at the school.

### Assigned Classes and Subjects

I was usually only assigned English classes. This is because El Peralejo is not a bilingual school, so the only subjects not taught in Spanish are French and English. I was assigned classes with each level at the school, i.e.:

* 3 years old
* 4 years old
* 5 years old
* 1st grade
* 2nd grade
* 3rd grade
* 4th grade
* 5th grade
* 6th grade
