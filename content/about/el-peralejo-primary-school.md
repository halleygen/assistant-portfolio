### Assigned Classes and Subjects

I was usually only assigned English classes. This is because El Peralejo is not a bilingual school, so the only subjects not taught in Spanish are French and English. I was assigned classes with each level at the school, i.e.:

* 3 years old
* 4 years old
* 5 years old
* 1st grade
* 2nd grade
* 3rd grade
* 4th grade
* 5th grade
* 6th grade
