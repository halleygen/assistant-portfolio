### Personal Background

I have always been fascinated with foreign languages and cultures. One Christmas when I was little my grandparents gave me an illustrated version of the Tower of Babel story and since then I have felt that being able to speak multiple languages is almost like having a superpower. I wanted to be able to speak every language! While I have given up on that dream (although I did end up learning Spanish, which means I know twice the number of languages I used to ðŸ˜œ), my desire to not only learn to communicate in a foreign language, but to help others to communicate in my language has only grown.

I was born in Australia, but my family and I have always moved around a lot because of my father's work. I have been fortunate enough to live in many places, both within Australia and around the world. The first time we moved overseas was to the Philippines when I first encountered Spanish. The Philippines was previously a Spanish colony, so the language and culture of the country has a lot of Hispanic influences: *la pelota vasca* is a popular sport, Filipinos like to take a siesta in the afternoon, *bistek*, *tocino* and *adobo* are famous Filipino dishes. This interested me, so when I offered Spanish or Chinese as a foreign language at school I chose Spanish.

After graduating from high school I returned to Australia to study finance and economics at university. At my university it was compulsory to take one subject unrelated to your major each semester. People from my faculty tended to take business law, but that seemed incredibly boring to me so I decided to continue with Spanish. In these classes we read a lot of Spanish literary works like *La casa de Bernarda Alba* and *Don Quijote*, which made me want to visit the country where these stories were set even more.

Towards the end of my university course I heard about the Language Assists Programme from one of my Spanish teachers and couldn't resist the opportunity to apply.

### Making This Website

I made this website using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), an open source project that generates static websites from markdown files. It is hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), which lets you host a website from a git repository for free. The theme I used is a simple one called [hugo-theme-learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn).

Although this method requires some familiarity with command-line tools, it requires next to no knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, etc. I found it much simpler than using the clunkier, yet more well known, web apps like Google Sites or Wix, which have made me tear my hair out in the past. Another benefit is that because Github Pages is based around git, everything is kept under source control, which makes it trivial to see every edit you have ever made to the site or its content.

I would recommend this method to language assistants who plan to do this portfolio project in the future.
