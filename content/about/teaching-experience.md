### Assigned Classes and Subjects

I was usually only assigned English classes. This is because El Peralejo is not a bilingual school, so the only subjects not taught in Spanish are French and English. My timetable was organised such that I did one English lesson each week with every class in the school. I liked this because it meant that I could spend time with all of the students, but it could also be challenging because it took me much longer to get to know them.

On special occasions, like leading up to the Australia Day event, my timetable was temporarily changed so that I could help to teach other subjects, such as physical education.

### Goals

#### Goals for Me

My primary goal is to become more confident at teaching and communicating new things to other people. When I am working with the kids I pretend that I cannot speak any Spanish so that they will not fall back to speaking their native language in more difficult situations instead of having a go in English. This means that there are plenty of times when I have to find ways to effectively convey complex and abstract concepts in a way that is easy for a child to understand. As the well known (and misattributed) Einstein quote *"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough"* goes, I feel that improving this skill will help me to teach my students much better. 

My secondary goal is to improve my level of Spanish. Although the majority of my students still believe that I do not speak any Spanish, there are still lots of times where I need to be able to effectively communicate in Spanish, for example, with people in Alpedrete that make up the El Peralejo community (like the family of the kids), and with teachers or other faculty members who do not speak English. Due to this I think that this is an important goal.

#### Goals for Learners

The main goal for my students is for them to feel more comfortable speaking in English. Speaking has been the most challenging part of learning Spanish for me because it makes me feel self-conscious that I cannot always express myself as well as I would in my native tongue. I hope that as the children get to know me and practice with me they can feel much more confident communicating with someone in a foreign language. 

Another goal I have is for them to improve their vocabulary and fluency. In my experience there are certain things that you cannot learn about a language with the resources that are typically available in a classroom (e.g. textbooks) because they can be too "static". Although Spanish and English seem to be very similar at first, speaking one as you would the other sounds very strange (and can sometimes mean an extremely different thing) to a native speaker. I hope that I can complement their normal English classes and help them with this.
