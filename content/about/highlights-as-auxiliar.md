### The Australian Accent

One of the things that I commonly hear from people who speak English as a second language is that Australians speak too quickly and have a difficult accent. As I have spent so much time living outside of Australia, my accent is not very strong; however, I knew that it could still prove to be challenging for some of the students and teachers at school because they are mostly used to hearing British and American people.

...

Despite this one of the highlights of the LA programme for me is hearing how some of the students have started to pick up my Australian accent. It is particularly noticable in words such as "*No*", which has a distinct pronounciation in Australian English.
