### Watching the Students Improve

One of the biggest highlights for me so far has been being able to see the progress that the students have made in English. Even though I have only been here for about half a year, I can already see a difference between their skills at the beginning of the year and now. Many of the younger children have also gained a lot of confidence and they hardly ever greet me in Spanish anymore like they used to. It makes me feel happy to have been able to work together with the other English teachers to help contribute to this.

### The Preschoolers

The preschoolers are some of my favourite students because they do so many adorable things. Also, as they are only just starting to learn English, the progress they make is much more apparent.

One of the five-year-olds I have a class with has an American father, so his English level is pretty much the same as that of a five-year-old from an English speaking country. For the first couple of weeks he was very timid and hardly spoke to anyone in English, but as we spent more time together in class he began to warm up to me. Now he is very talkative and asks me very cute questions like "Do you go home to Australia every day after school?" and "Do you know Kevin?". Kevin turned out to be his uncle who happens to live in Australia, and I didn't know him.

Another time, I read the four-year-olds a book about a monster who changes colour depending on the emotion he feels (e.g. red when angry, blue when sad, pink when in love). The next day when I asked one of them how he was he responded that was "pink for Miguel, Eloy y Joel" who are his best friends.

### The Australian Accent

One of the things that I commonly hear from people who speak English as a second language is that Australians speak too quickly and have a difficult accent. As I have spent so much time living outside of Australia, my accent is not very strong; however, I knew that it could still prove to be challenging for some of the students and teachers at school because they are mostly used to hearing British and American people.

Despite this everyone has been patient and one of the highlights of the LA programme for me is hearing how some of the students have started to pick up my Australian accent. It is particularly noticable in words such as "*No*", which has a distinct pronounciation in Australian English.
