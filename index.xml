      <title>El Peralejo School</title>

      <description>I was assigned to CEIP El Peralejo, which is a primary school (1st - 6th grade) and a pre-school (3 - 5 years old). It is located in Alpedrete, a small town in the mountains to the north-west of Madrid.
 I chose to live in the centre of Madrid rather than in Alpedrete, which was possible because the public transport is so good. Each morning I take the metro to the Intercambiador de Moncloa then catch a bus to Alpedrete.</description>

      <title>Teaching Experience</title>

      <description>Assigned Classes and Subjects I was usually only assigned English classes. This is because El Peralejo is not a bilingual school, so the only subjects not taught in Spanish are French and English. My timetable was organised such that I did one English lesson each week with every class in the school. I liked this because it meant that I could spend time with all of the students, but it could also be challenging because it took me much longer to get to know them.</description>

      <title>Australian Stories</title>

      <description>One of the after lunchtime activities was reading an Australian story. For some classes this was a collection of tales from Aboriginal mythology and for others it was Edward the Emu by Sheena Knowles.
The Aboriginal tales were popular because they are told in very different way compared to European stories. They also seemed to enjoy learning about Aboriginal culture because it is unique and so distinct from that of Spain.</description>

      <title>LA Highlights</title>

      <description>Watching the Students Improve One of the biggest highlights for me so far has been being able to see the progress that the students have made in English. Even though I have only been here for about half a year, I can already see a difference between their skills at the beginning of the year and now. Many of the younger children have also gained a lot of confidence and they hardly ever greet me in Spanish anymore like they used to.</description>

Each person puts on their hat and an animal flash card is sat in its brim, such that no one can knows the card that is in their hat, but can see those of their classmates.</description>

      <title>Alphabet Game</title>
      <link>https://halleygen.github.io/auxiliar-project/australia-day/alphabet-game/</link>

      <guid>https://halleygen.github.io/auxiliar-project/australia-day/alphabet-game/</guid>
      <description>This was an activity based on The Alphabet Game game show (the Spanish equivalent was called Pasapalabra). It consisted of a quiz where you had to guess twenty-six words relating to Australia (one for each letter of the English alphabet). Each letter had an associated clue and players worked in teams. The first team to get all twenty-six words correctly is the winner.
For example:
 B: One of the colours on the Australian flag: Blue C: A popular sport in Australia: Cricket J: The name for a baby kangaroo: Joey  This activity was probably the most difficult for the students because they don&amp;rsquo;t know much about Australia yet and in order to find a words for a some of the more uncommon letters, like X, you have to choose something niche.</description>

The focus of this unit was to teach the kids basic animal descriptions.</description>

      <title>Cricket</title>

      <guid>https://halleygen.github.io/auxiliar-project/australia-day/cricket/</guid>
      <description>In the morning of the Australia Day celebrations the children played cricket against each other. I thought that cricket would be a good sport for children in primary school because it is non-contact, and relies more on making intelligent decisions and less on athletic prowess. This means that it should be enjoyed by a greater percentage of the students that sports where this is not the case.
Although cricket is one of the most popular sports in Australia, it is almost unheard of here in Spain.</description>
